\section[\faGraduationCap]{Research}
{\small My research spans a broad range of geographical areas, focusing on coastal and sea- level changes. I investigate \textbf{modern coastal transformations} in Germany and Ghana. In tropical areas like Moorea, Tahiti, and Fiji, my studies explore the \textbf{interactions between modern coastal processes and coral reef ecological dynamics}. Additionally, I examine \textbf{paleo sea-level variations (from the Holocene to the Pliocene)} in diverse locations such as the Mediterranean, USA, Cape Verde, the Bahamas, Aruba, Curaçao, Bonaire, Madagascar, Bermuda, Argentina, Brazil, Seychelles, South Africa, and Indonesia. My work also entails studying the \textbf{underwater topography of coral reefs} in the Maldives. I employ a variety of methodologies to tackle the complexities of marine and coastal geomorphology at these globally distributed sites. I have led research expeditions to all the aforementioned locations, overseeing logistics, securing research permits, and orchestrating the scientific organization of the fieldwork on multiple occasions.} \\ \\

\section[\faEuro]{Funding}
{\normalsize \textbf{Research projects} -  As \textbf{Principal Investigator}, I have successfully led several research projects, securing a total of \textbf{~4.2 million \texteuro} in funding. In particular, I hold a Starting Grant from the European Research Council (ending in 2025), and I started my own research group at the University of Bremen and at the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research thanks to funding of the German Science Foundation. I have participated in several research projects as \textbf{Co-Principal Investigator}, for a total amount of \textbf{960 thousand \texteuro}.\\
\textbf{Conferences and workshops} - I have played a significant role in organizing conferences and workshops, directly managing funds provided by various associations and institutions to cover expenses and support the participation of \textbf{young scientists and scientists from low-income or developing countries}. I have contributed to grant writing and the management of funds. Overall, since 2012 I secured \textbf{\textasciitilde55 thousand \texteuro} from scientific associations such as PAGES, INQUA and the EGU.
