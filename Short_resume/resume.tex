\section[\faSlideshare]{Teaching}
I have been teaching several courses at the University of Bremen and Ca' Foscari University of Venice. I currently teach the courses \textbf{"Coastal hazards (MSc)"} and \textbf{"Physical geography and geomorphology (BSc)"} at Ca' Foscari and the course \textbf{"Sea Level Changes (MSc)"} at the University of Bremen.

\section[\faCompass]{Mentoring and supervision}
I have mentored \textbf{nine postdoctoral researchers}. Upon leaving my team, several researchers have successfully transitioned to other academic positions or into industry roles. I supervised \textbf{four doctoral students} until the completion of their thesis. I supervised as main or co-supervisor \textbf{twenty one BSc or MSc students} from different European Universities.

\section[\faEuro]{Funding}
\textbf{Research projects} -  As \textbf{Principal Investigator}, I have successfully led several research projects, securing a total of \textbf{~4.2 million \texteuro} in funding. In particular, I hold a Starting Grant from the European Research Council (ending in 2025), and I led my own research group at the University of Bremen and at the Leibniz Center for Tropical Marine Research thanks to funding of the German Science Foundation. I have participated in several research projects as \textbf{Co-Principal Investigator}, for a total amount of \textbf{960 thousand \texteuro}.
\bigskip
\textbf{Conferences and workshops} - I have played a significant role in organizing conferences and workshops, directly manag- ing funds provided by various associations and institutions to cover expenses and support the participation of \textbf{young scientists and scientists from low-income or developing countries}. I have contributed to grant writing and the management of funds. Overall, since 2012 I secured \textbf{\textasciitilde55 thousand \texteuro} from scientific associations such as PAGES, INQUA and the EGU.
