The study area is located 4-5 Km SW from Savona, along the western Ligurian coast. The Holocene transgression highlighted by the surveys was related to the variations of the landscape in the last 8-9000 years; this period corresponds to the beginning and the development of the Neolithic. Subaerial (Fig. 1) and marine (Fig. 2) morphological features were taken into account in order to compare the recent evolution of the study area with the most important Quaternary events, such as eustatism and tectonic activity. These two events are documented by 5 orders of marine terraces comprised between 185 and 35 m a.s.l.; this allowed us to conclude that the tectonic rising rates of the study area during Quaternary have been low, and successively decreased. This evidence supported the assertion that the study area has been substantially stable during Holocene. Moreover, systems of Quaternary faults have conditioned the direction of crests and the drainage patterns. The cores, 10 of which were made in the marine part of the study area, allowed us to recognize the substratum, that is constituted by lower Pliocene marly clays, by the continental deposits referable to the low eustatic stand (W{\""u}rm) and by the marine sedimentary body of the Holocene transgression (Fig. 8). The marine deposits of the Tyrrhenian transgression (Stage 5.5) are absent. 25 C14 datings provided calibrated ages comprised between 8225 and 510 yrs BP; the data were used to obtain the chronostrati- graphy of the marine deposit (Fig. 12). The correlation of the results obtained by the seismic profile analysis (Fig. 4), by the sedimento- logical study of the drilling cores (Fig. 5) and by the C14 datings allowed us to recognize a transgressive phase, which ended 6000 yrs BP; a period of relative eustatic standing (from 6000 to 5000 yrs BP); a subsequent period of progradation (from 5000 to 1800 yrs BP) and, finally, the period of the interglacial high eustatic stand that continues to the present (Fig. 14). The whole sedimentary marine body reaches a thickness of about 14 meters. The various stages of the eustatic sea level rise were reconstructed along a geologic profile that continues landward. The seismic profile was documented by the alignment of 9 cores; this allowed us to recognize the shorelines dated 8000 BP (-12 m), 7000 BP (-6,5 m), 6000 BP (-3 m), and 5000 BP (-1,5 m) (Fig. 14). On the basis of these data an eustatic curve was obtained (Fig.15) and the large modifications of the landscape caused by the Holocene transgression were recognised. About 9000 yrs BP a large surface with a low inclination spread landward for at least 1 Km; taking into account the improvement of the clima- te, this plain could be used for agriculture. However, in the space of 3000 years, the plain was flooded by the rising sea level, while the valley floor of the Segno river became inhospitable, because it began to be flooded by continuous inundations. After a period of relati- ve stability, that had lasted since 5000 yrs BP, the continued accumulation of debris along the coast caused the progradation of both the emerged and submerged beaches and the contemporaneous aggradation of the alluvial plain of the Segno river. This drove the ancient inhabitants to live and build mainly on the hillsides, mainly in the terraced surfaces. Starting from 8000 yrs BP till present, the coastline became again relatively stable; in the sea bottom the deposition of the sedimentary sequence relative to the last eustatic interglacial peak began. The alluvial plain of the Segno river became stable again or useful for agriculture, even if not in a permanent way. The reduction of space and the probable increase in the population lead to the use of deforestation; this started with the washing of the hillsides and the erosion of soils, as documented by the thick silty-clayey body that rapidly formed in the marine area.",,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Especially in the marine environment, conservation effort is often focused on the biological elements only, while multi-disciplinary approaches, including abiotic elements and social issues, are needed. 3. A procedure to evaluate the Marine Natural Heritage (MNH) as a whole, integrating geomorphology and biology, was tested in two coastal areas in the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean): Punta Manara, a European Site of Community Interest (SCI), and Finale -- Vado Ligure (non-SCI). In each area, scuba surveys were carried out at six sites to categorize subtidal landforms and habitats, and these were then used as evaluation units for assigning scores to subcategories of both geomorphological (Integrity, Representativeness, Rarity, Paleogeographic, Aesthetic) and biological (Naturalness, Vulnerability, Rarity, Economic, Aesthetic) categories. 4. Four sites in the area of Punta Manara obtained high scores, thus fully justifying the special management measures required for SCI implementation. However, two sites in the Finale -- Vado Ligure area exhibited biological heritage values higher than those of Punta Manara, while a third site exhibited values comparable with those of Punta Manara when considering both biology and geomorphology. This highlighted the presence of features worth conserving also in non-SIC situations. 5. Accessibility to scuba divers was evaluated by means of a simple scheme, and added information on the perception of MNH in the study sites. 6. It is suggested that the evaluation system may be used, with appropriate benchmarking, in other areas for the selection of sites proposed for legal protection or special management measures, based on their natural heritage values.",10527613,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Unexpected ecosystem change is becoming frequent, and the complex ways through which multiple human pressures may interact leave conservation practitioners and natural resource managers faced with high uncertainty. We developed a geospatial approach for modeling the complex relationships between multiple human pressures and coastal ecosystems status. This framework was then used to produce maps of the expected status of marine coastal ecosystems resulting from variation in the cumulative human pressure. The geospatial modeling approach we developed was tested on an emblematic study case requiring marine spatial planning, i.e. a recently established marine protected area (MPA) that will have to coexist with the expansion of a close commercial harbor. In the study case presented, our modeling approach was used to predict the status of coastal ecosystems resulting from different management alternatives. Results showed that should Port Authority support MPA in reducing human pressures in the area, coastal ecosystems would not be expected to further deteriorate as a consequence of harbor expansion. Our approach proved effective in modeling complex interaction among multiple pressures (e.g. synergisms) and predicting potential future scenarios. The implementation of this approach into geographical information systems (GIS) allows managers to represent the expected outcomes of their planned conservation efforts, thereby representing an important decision-support tool for finding efficient management solutions in the face of complex interactions and high uncertainty. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a paucity of presently available data in this sector of the Aegean Sea, which is a tectonically active area strongly controlled by the North Anatolian Fault. In this paper, morphological, biological and sedimentary records of paleo-sea levels have been used to reconstruct relative sea-level changes, to identify variations in the tectonic regimes as well as to assess the paleoseismicity in the studied areas. According to the results, late Quaternary relative sea-level changes at Lesvos were not homogenous and variations in the tectonic setting played a crucial role in the coastal evolution. The NW-SE trending faults on the southern shore of the island control a significant uplift affecting about 30. km of coastline. This uplift trend is controlled by the footwall of the Lesvos Fault, a major offshore normal fault that has been subject to relatively little quantitative investigation. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the last co-seismic uplift took place at 3365-3963. cal. yr BP and resulted in about 0.75. m of vertical displacement. In contrast, all the paleo-sea-level markers mapped in the northeastern sector were presently underwater and, despite the high seismicity of the area, no evidence of coastal uplift was observed in this part of the island. Thus, the paper provides the first field evidence of a differential late Quaternary evolution of Lesvos Island. In addition, results represent the first quantitative information on the activity of the Lesvos Fault, suggesting a reconsideration of its importance in the neotectonics of the area. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.",0169555X,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Among them, many authors used boulder fields as important indicators of past tsunamis, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. The aim of this study was to understand the mechanism of deposition of clusters of large boulders, consisting of beachrock slabs, which were found on the southern coasts of Lesvos Island (NE Aegean Sea). Methods to infer the origin of boulder deposits (tsunami vs. storm wave) are often based on hydrodynamic models even if different environmental complexities are difficult to be incorporated into numerical models. In this study, hydrodynamic equations did not provide unequivocal indication of the mechanism responsible for boulder deposition in the study area. Further analyses, ranging from geomorphologic to seismotectonic data, indicated a tsunami as the most likely cause of displacement of the boulders but still do not allow to totally exclude the extreme storm origin. Additional historical investigations (based on tsunami catalogues, historical photos and aged inhabitants interviews) indicated that the boulders are likely to have been deposited by the tsunami triggered by the 6.7 M s Chios-Karaburum earthquake of 1949 or, alternatively, by minor effects of the destructive tsunami produced by 1956's Amorgos Island earthquake.

In order to crowdsource sea level data from the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period, we developed three tools: PlioWiki, RSLcalcand RSLmap. PlioWiki is a web portal, open to contributions, where investigators can share knowledge on Pliocene to Quaternary relative sea levels. RSLcalcis a standardized, ready-to-use tool for field geologists to log their own sea level field observations and, if they desire, submit new data to an open access database of relative sea level markers. RSLmapallows one to visualize and query the database built with RSLcalcon a Google Map interface.

Best practices should involve some form of monitoring prior to, during and post beach re-building. The most frequently applied monitoring techniques for Italian (and Mediterra- nean) beaches are topographic and bathymetric surveys carried out in regular time intervals in order to understand beach evolution. Morphological studies, based on grain- size profile analyses, can indicate the sedimentary evolution of the beach. In the present study, SCUBA diving techniques were employed in addition to traditional survey methods in order to monitor two study areas along the Ligurian coast (northwest Mediterranean Sea): Ospedaletti and Genova Vernazzola. In particular, a diver-operated, cost-effective coring system obtained marine sediment cores, and video transects and inspections generated information on the status of coastal defence structures (e.g. groynes). Using those methods, the main vertical discontinuities along the submarine beach were identified, as were points of erosion on the submarine parts of groynes. Such innovative techniques provided data that are not easily achievable with traditional monitoring techniques. Future monitoring programmes should consider these new methods as a way of improving assessment efficiency. Keywords:",17560543,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Estimates of eustatic sea level based on geologic data span a broad range; variation that we now recognize is due in part to geographically varying post-depositional displacement caused by glacial isostatic adjustment and dynamic topography. In this study, we combine field observations and glacial isostatic adjustment modeling to estimate the dynamic topography signal in three areas that are important to paleo-sea level studies of the Mid-Pliocene warm period (South Africa, West Australia and southeastern United States). We show that dynamic topography played a significant role in the post-depositional displacement of Pliocene, and even younger Pleistocene, shorelines. In this regard, we provide a robust paleo-sea level elevation data set, corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment, that can be used to evaluate predictions from mantle flow models of dynamic topography. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.",0012821X,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

The North Eastern Aegean Sea is among the tectonically complex sectors of the Eastern Mediterranean, mainly influenced by the activity of the North Anatolian Fault. In this paper, we created a relative sea level (RSL) database by expanding upon the previous compilation with recently published geological and archaeological data. We reconstruct the RSL history in those Aegean coastal sectors located within the South Marmara microplate, a broad shear zone located between western Anatolia and central Greece and affected by dominant strike-slip faulting, at times combined with a normal component. Then, we compared it with the RSL histories obtained for the surrounding coastal sectors. The analysis of the database indicated that it is not possible to define a common Holocene RSL curve for the entire NE Aegean, as RSL history here is majorly influenced by changes in deformation patterns. In addition, data in our database are consistent with a continuous RSL rise in the last 6.0 ka BP in the whole NE Aegean Sea and cannot support the hypothesis of a mid-Holocene RSL highstand in the area. Finally, we present our best estimates of late Holocene rates of RSL prior to any possible acceleration during the twentieth century in the broad area of NE Aegean. Here we identified the fastest rising rate (∼0.9 mm a-1) in that sector whose active tectonic deformation is mainly controlled by the North Anatolian Fault activity. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",10406182,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Should sonogram interpretation be efficient, repeated mapping would allow evaluation of spatial meadow dynamics through time. Here, maps of Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadows from western Liguria (NW Mediterranean Sea) produced in 1990, 1991 and 2006 through SSS surveys, were processed with GIS (Geographical Information System) and compared by means of diachronic analysis to establish concordances and discordances. While any difference between maps of 1990 and 2006 might provide information about change in seagrass cover with time, the availability of maps taken at only one year of distance (1991 vs 1990) offered the unique opportunity to evaluate the efficiency of SSS mapping, as the slow dynamics of P. oceanica makes significant change over such a short time scale unrealistic in absence of any large-scale environmental catastrophe. Results showed obvious differences in P. oceanica meadow distribution among the three periods in most of the areas. The largest differences were found between the maps of 1990 and 1991. This discrepancy was probably due to erroneous interpretation of small, fragmented shallow-water meadows on sonograms. Errors in sonogram interpretation combine with inefficient positioning in old cartographies to blur the evaluation of change over large time scales (i.e. between 1990 and 2006). Extensive sea-truthing based on a rigorous design is mandatory for efficient acoustic mapping of seagrass meadows.",03043770,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

In order to assess this hypothesis, we measured modern tidal notches in several of sites along the Mediterranean coasts. We report observations on tidal notches cut along carbonate coasts from 73 sites from Italy, France, Croatia, Montenegro, Greece, Malta and Spain, plus additional observations carried outside the Mediterranean. At each site, we measured notch width and depth, and we described the characteristics of the biological rim at the base of the notch. We correlated these parameters with wave energy, tide gauge datasets and rock lithology.Our results suggest that, considering 'the development of tidal notches the consequence of midlittoral bioerosion' (as done in Evelpidou et al., 2012) is a simplification that can lead to misleading results, such as stating that notches are disappearing. Important roles in notch formation can be also played by wave action, rate of karst dissolution, salt weathering and wetting and drying cycles. Of course notch formation can be augmented and favoured also by bioerosion which can, in particular cases, be the main process of notch formation and development.Our dataset shows that notches are carved by an ensemble rather than by a single process, both today and in the past, and that it is difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle them and establish which one is prevailing. We therefore show that tidal notches are still forming, challenging the hypothesis that sea level rise has drowned them.",02773791,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Here we show how combining historical quantitative data with descriptive `naturalistic' information arranged in a chronological chain allows highlighting long-term trends and can be used to inform present conservation schemes.We analysed the long-term change of a coralligenous reef, a marine habitat en- demic to the Mediterranean Sea. The coralligenous assemblages of Mesco Reef (Ligurian Sea,NWMediterranean) have been studied, although discontinuously, since 1937 thus making available both detailed descriptive information and scanty quantitative data: while the former was useful to understand the natural history of the ecosystem, the analysis of the latter was of paramount importance to provide a formal measure of change over time. Epi- benthic assemblages remained comparatively stable until the 1990s, when species re- placement, invasion by alien algae, and biotic homogenisation occurred within few years, leading to a new and completely different ecosystem state. The shift experienced by the cor- alligenous assemblages of Mesco Reef was probably induced by a combination of seawa- ter warming and local human pressures, the latter mainly resulting in increased water turbidity; in turn, cumulative stress may have favoured the establishment of alien species. This study showed that the combined analysis of quantitative and descriptive historical data represent a precious knowledge to understand ecosystem trends over time and provide help to identify baselines for ecological management.",1932-6203,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Here we review published geologic maps and compare them to paleoshoreline locations obtained through geomorphometric classification and satellite data. We furthermore present the results of an extensive field campaign that measured the mid-Pliocene (∼. 3.3-2.9. Ma) shorelines of the Atlantic Coastal Plain using high-accuracy GPS and digital elevation models. We compare our new dataset to positions and elevations extracted from published maps and find that the extracted site information from earlier studies is prone to significant error, both in the location and, more severely, in the elevation of the paleoshoreline. We also investigate, using geophysical modeling, the origin of post-depositional displacement of the shoreline from Georgia to Virginia. In particular, we correct the elevation of our shoreline for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and then compare the corrected elevation to predictions of mantle flow-induced dynamic topography (DT). While a subset of these models does reconcile the general trends in the observed elevation of the mid-Pliocene shoreline, local discrepancies persist. These discrepancies suggests that either (i) the DT and GIA models presented here do not capture the full range of uncertainty in the input parameters; and/or (ii) other influences, such as sediment loading and unloading or local fault-driven tectonics, may have contributed to post-depositional deformation of the mid-Pliocene shoreline that are not captured in the above models. In this context, our field measurements represent an important observational dataset with which to compare future generations of geodynamic models. Improvements in models for DT, GIA and other relevant processes, together with an expanded, geographically distributed set of shoreline records, will ultimately be the key to obtaining more accurate estimates of eustatic sea level not only in the mid-Pliocene but also earlier in the Cenozoic.",00128252,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Here we focus on this island's MIS 5e fossil record, offering a comprehensive review on the palaeobiodiversity, palaeoecology and palaeobiogeography of the biota living in the mid North Atlantic during this interglacial. Several studies in oceanic islands stress the huge impact of sea level changes on insular communities. Pleistocene sea-level changes occur during the short-time events known as ""Terminations"" (associated to glacial/interglacial shifts) as well as with the onset of glaciations (associated to interglacial/glacial shifts). Both are responsible for extinctions and local disappearance of species, bottleneck effects and formation of new species, resulting in community structure changes.

Although thermophilic members of the ""Senegalese"" tropical fauna were found in these deposits, many of the most emblematic species (e.g., Persististrombus latus (= Strombus bubonius), Cymbula safiana, Harpa doris, Cardita senegalensis, Barbatia plicata, Ctena eburnea or Hyotissa hyotis) are absent, suggesting that they did not reach the Azores. Our results indicate that the main differences between the species composition of the MIS 5e and the present-day shallow-water Azorean communities are probably due to the dropping of sea surface temperature associated with the onset of the last glaciation, which had both direct and indirect effects on species ecology. A group of 21 thermophilic species was directly affected by the lower sea surface temperature, whereas a group of four sand-associated species was indirectly but similarly affected by the lowering of the sea level. Both groups have locally disappeared from the Azores. However, none of the extant endemic species found on the studied MIS 5e outcrops was apparently affected by the lowering SST. In contrast to the biogeographical relationships of the recent Azorean shallow marine molluscs, which are predominantly with the Mediterranean Region, Portugal and with the Madeira and Canary Islands archipelagos, the palaeobiogeographical relationships of the MIS 5e Azorean marine molluscs are mainly with Canaries and West Africa. Despite the general low similarity of the biogeographical relationships between the Azores and Cape Verde Archipelago, on both the recent and the MIS 5e analysis, this similarity is nevertheless higher for the MIS 5e mollusc assemblages, emphasizing the role of Cape Verde as an important source of warm-water species during the Last Interglacial.",02773791,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

They are shown to occur from the intertidal to abyssal depths, in tropical, temperate, and high latitudes and sometimes to create spectacular formations, such as glass sponge reefs, lithistid reef-like fields, and carnivorous sponge grounds. Sponge aggregations are recognized as singular vulnerable habitats that deserve special research attention and legal protection. However, this review reveals that there is only a poor and fragmentary under- standing of the main biological, environmental, and geochemical factors that favor and maintain these systems, including the food supply, which is funda- mental knowledge. There is also a particular lack of information regarding reproductive biology, growth rates, life spans, and the main factors causing mortality, all crucial drivers for understanding population and community dynamics and for developing conservation strategies. The sponge aggregations have been shown to increase the structural complexity of the habitats, attracting a larger variety of organisms and locally enhancing biodiversity. From the very few cases in which sponge biomass and sponge physiology have been reliably approached jointly, phenomenal fluxes of matter and energy have been inferred. Through their benthic-pelagic coupling, some of the densest sponge aggrega- tions have a significant local or regional impact on major biogeochemical cycles and food webs. Physical damage and habitat destruction derived from man-driven activities along with epidemic diseases facilitated by global envi- ronmental alterations emerge as major threats to the future of the sponge aggregations.",,,,,Marine {Animal} {Forests}: {The} {Ecology} of {Benthic} {Biodiversity} {Hotspots},,,"Rossi, S. and Bramanti, L. and Gori, A. and del Valle, C.",,All rights reserved,7=highlight,Cham,,

Here we review published geologic maps and compare them to paleoshoreline locations obtained through geomorphometric classification and satellite data. We furthermore present the results of an extensive field campaign that measured the mid-Pliocene ({\textasciitilde} 3.3-2.9 Ma) shorelines of the Atlantic Coastal Plain using high-accuracy GPS and digital elevation models. We compare our new dataset to positions and elevations extracted from published maps and find that the extracted site information from earlier studies is prone to significant error, both in the location and, more severely, in the elevation of the paleoshoreline. We also investigate, using geophysical modeling, the origin of post-depositional displacement of the shoreline from Georgia to Virginia. In particular, we correct the elevation of our shoreline for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and then compare the corrected elevation to predictions of mantle flow-induced dynamic topography (DT). While a subset of these models does reconcile the general trends in the observed elevation of the mid-Pliocene shoreline, local discrepancies persist. These discrepancies suggests that either (i) the DT and GIA models presented here do not capture the full range of uncertainty in the input parameters; and/or (ii) other influences, such as sediment loading and unloading or local fault-driven tectonics, may have contributed to post-depositional deformation of the mid-Pliocene shoreline that are not captured in the above models. In this context, our field measurements represent an important observational dataset with which to compare future generations of geodynamic models. Improvements in models for DT, GIA and other relevant processes, together with an expanded, geographically distributed set of shoreline records, will ultimately be the key to obtaining more accurate estimates of eustatic sea level not only in the mid-Pliocene but also earlier in the Cenozoic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,data set

In order to assess this hypothesis, we measured modern tidal notches in several of sites along the Mediterranean coasts. We report observations on tidal notches cut along carbonate coasts from 73 sites from Italy, France, Croatia, Montenegro, Greece, Malta and Spain, plus additional observations carried outside the Mediterranean. At each site, we measured notch width and depth, and we described the characteristics of the biological rim at the base of the notch. We correlated these parameters with wave energy, tide gauge datasets and rock lithology.\\
\\
Our results suggest that, considering {\textquotesingle}the development of tidal notches the consequence of midlittoral bioerosion{\textquotesingle} (as done in Evelpidou et al., 2012) is a simplification that can lead to misleading results, such as stating that notches are disappearing. Important roles in notch formation can be also played by wave action, rate of karst dissolution, salt weathering and wetting and drying cycles. Of course notch formation can be augmented and favoured also by bioerosion which can, in particular cases, be the main process of notch formation and development.\\
\\
Our dataset shows that notches are carved by an ensemble rather than by a single process, both today and in the past, and that it is difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle them and establish which one is prevailing. We therefore show that tidal notches are still forming, challenging the hypothesis that sea level rise has drowned them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,data set

Holocene sea-level data from literature on the west coast of Sulawesi, central Indonesia, suggest that this region experienced two relative sea-level highstands over the last 6000years, with magnitudes exceeding two meters. However, recent datasets from the Indo-Pacific region do not support high-magnitude sea-level oscillations during the Holocene in tectonically stable far-field locations. Here we present a new, high-precision, mid-Holocene sea-level dataset from the Spermonde Shelf off southwest Sulawesi. We surveyed 21 fossil microatolls on the reef flats of two coral islands (Pulau Panambungan and Pulau Barrang Lompo) and referred their elevations to local mean sea level and to the height of living coral. Radiometrically calibrated ages from emergent fossil microatolls on Pulau Panambungan indicate a relative sea-level highstand not exceeding 0.5m above present at ca. 5600cal.yrBP. The highstand is followed by a relatively rapid sea-level fall towards present sea level that was reached at around 4000cal.yrBP. Fossil microatolls from nearby Pulau Barrang Lompo show the same trend, however with a coherent negative vertical offset of about 0.8m compared to their equivalents on Pulau Panambungan. The largely consistent gradients of both trends (∼−0.14mmyr−1), the consistent elevation of living microatolls in the Spermonde, and a number of instructive geomorphic features indicate a localized, post-formational and probably recent drop of the fossil microatolls on the densely populated island Pulau Barrang Lompo. The relative sea-level trend inferred from Pulau Panambungan is well within the range of geophysical predictions based on ANICE-SELEN ice sheet model, which predict a highstand that is significantly lower than those predicted by other GIA models for this area. Although a complete interpretation of the Holocene sea-level history will require additional high-resolution datasets from this and surrounding territories in SE Asia, our results suggest that there was merely a single Holocene highstand in central Indonesia, the magnitude of which was substantially lower than hitherto assumed.",0169555X,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Between the first and second surveys, the study area was hit by two storms (10--11 November 2013 and 21--22 November 2013) with waves approaching from the E--NNE, causing a shoreline retreat which, in some sectors, reached 7 m. Between the second and third surveys, by contrast, four storms (25--27 December 2013, 5--6 January 2014, 17--18 January 2014 and 6--10 February 2014) with waves propagating from the SE produced a general advancement of the shoreline (up to ∼5 m) by deposition of sediments along some parts of the beach. The data also reflect changes in beach topography due to human activity during the 2013 fall season, when private beach managers quarried ∼178 m3 of sediments on the emerged beach near the shoreline to accumulate them landwards.

In this context, the importance of diazotrophy for reef productivity is still not resolved, with studies up to now lacking organismal and seasonal resolution. Here, we present a budget of gross primary production (GPP) and BNF for a highly seasonal Red Sea fringing reef, based on ecophysiological and benthic cover measurements combined with geospatial analyses. Benthic GPP varied from 215 to 262 mmol C m -2 reef d-1, with hard corals making the largest contribution (41-76\%). Diazotrophy was omnipresent in space and time, and benthic BNF varied from 0.16 to 0.92 mmol N m-2 reef d-1. Planktonic GPP and BNF rates were respectively approximately 60- and 20-fold lower than those of the benthos, emphasizing the importance of the benthic compartment in reef biogeochemical cycling. BNF showed higher sensitivity to seasonality than GPP, implying greater climatic control on reef BNF. Up to about 20\% of net reef primary production could be supported by BNF during summer, suggesting a strong biogeochemical coupling between diazotrophy and the reef carbon cycle.

The climate at that time was warmer than today, primarily due to different orbital conditions, with smaller ice sheets and higher sea-level. Field evidence for MIS 5e sea-level was reported from thousands of sites, but often paleo shorelines were measured with low-accuracy techniques and, in some cases, there are contrasting interpretations about paleo sea-level reconstructions. For this reason, large uncertainties still surround both the maximum sea-level attained as well as the pattern of sea-level change throughout MIS 5e. Such uncertainties are exacerbated by the lack of a uniform approach to measuring and interpreting the geological evidence of paleo sea-levels. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of MIS 5e field observations, and we set the basis for a standardized approach to MIS 5e paleo sea-level reconstructions, that is already successfully applied in Holocene sea-level research.

These RSL data-points were coupled with the large number of archaeological RSL indicators available for the western Mediterranean. We assessed the spatial variability of RSL histories for 22 regions and compared these with the ICE-5G (VM2) GIA model. In the western Mediterranean, RSL rose continuously for the whole Holocene with a sudden slowdown at ∼. 7.5 ka BP and a further deceleration during the last ∼. 4.0 ka BP, after which time observed RSL changes are mainly related to variability in isostatic adjustment. The sole exception is southern Tunisia, where data show evidence of a mid-Holocene high-stand compatible with the isostatic impacts of the melting history of the remote Antarctic ice sheet.Our results indicate that late-Holocene sea-level rise was significantly slower than the current one. First estimates of GIA contribution indicate that, at least in the northwestern sector, it accounts at least for the 25-30\% of the ongoing sea-level rise recorded by Mediterranean tidal gauges. Such contribution is less constrained at lower latitudes due to the lower quality of the late Holocene index points.

We measured the elevation of several RSL indicators with high-accuracy differential GPS (vertical accuracies down to 0.1 m) and we established the relationship between each RSL indicator and the paleo sea level through calculation of the indicative meaning for each RSL indicator. In particular, we present a novel technique to calculate the indicative meaning of fossil beach deposits with a phase-averaged morphodynamic model (CSHORE). We show how this approach helps overcoming difficulties with the survey of the modern analogs for these indicators. Our results show that two paleo RSLs are imprinted in Mallorca at + 2.9 $\pm$ 0.8 m and + 11.3 $\pm$ 1.0 m. We then compare our field-based results with modelled paleo RSL, calculated from the predictions of the ice-earth coupled ANICE-SELEN model, using few different ice-sheet melting scenarios during MIS 5e. We conclude that indicative ranges can be derived from relatively simple morphodynamic models and that the comparison of field-derived and modelled RSL values is a good method to validate possible scenarios of MIS 5e sea-level variability, especially in absence of precise dating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,data set

Geological and geomorphological landscape studies are critical to archaeology. Coastal regions provide a wide range of resources to the populations that inhabit them. Coastal landscapes are increasingly the focus of scholarly discussions from the earliest exploitation of littoral resources and early hominin cognition, to the inundation of the earliest permanently settled fishing villages and eventually, formative centres of urbanisation. In the Mediterranean, these would become hubs of maritime transportation that gave rise to the roots of modern seaborne trade. As such, this article represents an original review of both the geo-scientific and archaeological data that specifically relate to sea-level changes and resulting impacts on both physical and cultural landscapes from the Palaeolithic until the emergence of the Classical periods. Our review highlights that the interdisciplinary links between coastal archaeology, geomorphology and sea-level changes are important to explain environmental impacts on coastal human societies and human migration. We review geological indicators of sea level and outline how archaeological features are commonly used as proxies for measuring past sea levels, both gradual changes and catastrophic events. We argue that coastal archaeologists should, as a part of their analyses, incorporate important sea-level concepts, such as indicative meaning. The interpretation of the indicative meaning of Roman fishtanks, for example, plays a critical role in reconstructions of late Holocene Mediterranean sea levels. We identify avenues for future work, which include the consideration of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in addition to coastal tectonics to explain vertical movements of coastlines, more research on Palaeolithic island colonisation, broadening of Palaeolithic studies to include materials from the entire coastal landscape and not just coastal resources, a focus on rescue of archaeological sites under threat by coastal change, and expansion of underwater archaeological explorations in combination with submarine geomorphology.

Field evidence for MIS 5e sea-level was reported from thousands of sites, but often paleo shorelines were measured with low-accuracy techniques and, in some cases, there are contrasting interpretations about paleo sea-level reconstructions. For this reason, large uncertainties still surround both the maximum sea-level attained as well as the pattern of sea-level change throughout MIS 5e. Such uncertainties are exacerbated by the lack of a uniform approach to measuring and interpreting the geological evidence of paleo sea-levels. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of MIS 5e field observations, and we set the basis for a standardized approach to MIS 5e paleo sea-level reconstructions, that is already successfully applied in Holocene sea-level research. Application of the standard definitions and methodologies described in this paper will enhance our ability to compare data from different research groups and different areas, in order to gain deeper insights into MIS 5e sea-level changes.

In this study, we show how the three points above have been addressed in a focused study on Last Interglacial outcrops on the island of Mallorca. We measured the elevation of several RSL indicators with high-accuracy differential GPS (vertical accuracies down to 0.1 m) and we established the relationship between each RSL indicator and the paleo sea level through calculation of the indicative meaning for each RSL indicator. In particular, we present a novel technique to calculate the indicative meaning of fossil beach deposits with a phase-averaged morphodynamic model (CSHORE). We show how this approach helps overcoming difficulties with the survey of the modern analogs for these indicators. Our results show that two paleo RSLs are imprinted in Mallorca at + 2.9 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.8 m and + 11.3 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.0 m. We then compare our field-based results with modelled paleo RSL, calculated from the predictions of the ice-earth coupled ANICE-SELEN model, using few different ice-sheet melting scenarios during MIS 5e.

Santa Maria Island in the Azores is an ocean island volcano with a complex evolutionary history with subsidence followed by uplift. The island emerged by surtseyan activity at approximately 6 Ma, entailing in the formation of a subaerial shield volcano that was fully developed by ∼5.6 Ma. The edifice then experienced a period of intense erosion and subsidence, during which it was partially or completely truncated to a shallow submarine bank. Around 5 Ma, volcanism resumed on the eastern side of the edifice, with occasional submarine/surtseyan activity synchronous with marine deposition. By ∼4.3 Ma, volcanism grew in intensity forming a new edifice centred on the eastern flank of the underlying edifice. This new volcanic edifice started as submarine and then, as it gradually grew upwards and outpaced subsidence, breached sea level and formed a new island. The new edifice kept growing eastwards and northwards until ∼3.5 Ma, when volcanic activity waned. At 3.5-3.2 Ma, however, subsidence reversed to an uplift trend that extended throughout the Upper Pleistocene into the present. This uplift trend is responsible for the generation of a staircase of shore platforms on the windward side of the island, which extends up to ∼230 m in elevation. The fact that an island located in very young lithosphere experienced such a pronounced uplift trend is remarkable and raises important questions concerning possible uplift mechanisms. The loading of the neighbouring island of S{\~a}o Miguel may account for part of the uplift, but not the majority. Vertical tectonics along the nearby Gloria Fault is not completely implausible but unlikely to be a source of significant uplift due to its dominant strike-slip character. Thus, other mechanisms need to be considered, most notably intrusions at the base of the edifice and crustal thickening, suggesting that these play a significant role even on islands standing on a young lithosphere, such as in the Azores.",19432674,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Proposing an MPA and then failing to establish it risks advertising the beauty of a marine area without managing the unavoidable increase in tourism. This is what happened at Gallinara Island (Ligurian Sea, north-western Mediterranean), where an MPA was proposed in 1990 but has not yet been established. 3. Benthic data collected soon after the proposal (1990--92) have been compared with similar information obtained in subsequent periods (2009 and 2016): change has been assessed both visually and statistically, using multivariate and univariate techniques. 4. The Gallinara sea floor supported five epibenthic communities in 1991, four of which corresponded to European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitats; the fifth epibenthic community, characterized by the erect sponge Axinella polypoides, should be included in the next revision of EUNIS. 5. In the 25 years since the original MPA proposal, all epibenthic communities have exhibited a reduction in their three-dimensional structure and biotic homogenization, and severe decreases in species diversity, and the sea floor has been littered with derelict fishing gear and other waste from boats. 6. In absence of the MPA, proposals to develop a management plan for a marine Site of Community Importance (SCI) have been provided, to reduce sea-based human pressures. The dramatic alteration of Gallinara sea floor after 25 years of negligence and inaction is a sad warning for other unmanaged yet beautiful natural areas within urbanized regions of the world.",10527613,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

First, they can be used to constrain the melting of Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets in response to global warming scenarios. Second, they can be used to calculate the vertical crustal rates at active margins. For both applications, the contribution of glacio- and hydro-isostatic adjustment (GIA) to vertical displacement of sea-level indicators must be calculated. In this paper, we re-assess MIS 5e sea-level indicators at 11 Mediterranean sites that have been generally considered tectonically stable or affected by mild tectonics. These are found within a range of elevations of 2--10 m above modern mean sea level. Four sites are characterized by two separate sea-level stands, which suggest a two-step sea-level highstand during MIS 5e. Comparing field data with numerical modeling we show that (i) GIA is an important contributor to the spatial and temporal variability of the sea-level highstand during MIS 5e, (ii) the isostatic imbalance from the melting of the MIS 6 ice sheet can produce a {\textbackslash}textgreater2.0 m sea-level highstand, and (iii) a two-step melting phase for the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets reduces the differences between observations and predictions. Our results show that assumptions of tectonic stability on the basis of the MIS 5e records carry intrinsically large uncertainties, stemming either from uncertainties in field data and GIA models. The latter are propagated to either Holocene or Pleistocene sea-level reconstructions if tectonic rates are considered linear through time.",02773791,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

The HOLSEA meetings brought together sea-level researchers to agree upon a consistent protocol to standardize, interpret, and incorporate realistic uncertainties of RSL data. This special issue provides RSL data from ten geographical regions including new databases from Atlantic Europe and the Russian Arctic and revised/expanded databases from Atlantic Canada, the British Isles, the Netherlands, the western Mediterranean, the Adriatic, Israel, Peninsular Malaysia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean. In total, the database derived from this special issue includes 5634 (5290 validated) index (n = 3202) and limiting points (n = 2088) that span from ∼20,000 years ago to present. Progress in improving the standardization of sea-level databases has also been accompanied by advancements in statistical and analytical methods used to infer spatial patterns and rates of RSL change from geological data that have a spatially and temporally sparse distribution and geochronological and elevational uncertainties.

The standardized review of published age-elevation information from corals, deltaic, estuarine and mangrove deposits, beachrocks and tidal notches, yielded a new suite of relative sea-level index and limiting points produced according to a standardized protocol. Expected spatial variability in Holocene relative sea-level change due to glacial isostatic adjustment was accounted for, by first subdividing the study area into ten geographic sub-regions from the Central Indian Ocean to the Western Tropical Pacific, and second by comparing sub-regional relative sea-level data to model predictions of glacial isostatic adjustment. Results show that some of the regionally constrained relative sea-level data are characterized by significant inconsistencies that cannot be explained by glacial isostatic adjustment. Such inconsistencies of standardized relative sea-level data become particularly obvious in areas around the Red River Delta in Vietnam, the Gulf of Thailand, the northwest coast of Malaysia and the Spermonde Archipelago in Indonesia. Based on a critical evaluation of the reviewed relative sea-level indicators, we discuss possible sources of local divergence and identify regions where data are currently insufficient to constrain glacial isostatic adjustment predictions. The remaining quality-controlled and consistent relative sea-level data show that glacial isostatic adjustment and syn-/post-formational influences such as tectonic uplift, subsidence and compaction were the dominant local drivers of Holocene relative sea-level change. Collectively, the results of this review suggest that Holocene sea levels in South and Southeast Asia and surrounding regions have been controlled by a variety of global and local drivers and imply that additional index points from the Java Sea in Indonesia would be valuable to better assess the spatial variability, and to calibrate geophysical models of glacial isostatic adjustment.",02773791,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

Finally, we compared the standard diver-based coral reef mapping approach used at the MPA with the use of a map produced with the UAV. Our results suggest that the use of UAVs by conservation practitioners in MPAs with diverse habitats, such as in the tropics, is likely to improve the knowledge of the MPAs environments and provide highly detailed information for monitoring helping to understand the nursery function of these inter-connected tropical habitats, at a reduced cost.

Squeezed between Corsica and Sardinia islands, this strait connects the two major basins of the western Mediterranean. Due to its peculiar geographic and morphological setting, the Bonifacio Strait is affected by extreme meteomarine conditions characterized by severe winds, waves, and currents. The millennial sea-level changes were reconstructed through multiproxy investigations made of sediment coring and underwater beachrock sampling carried out on both sides of the strait. These data provided fresh insights into the timing of the progressive opening of the Bonifacio Strait which followed the Last Glacial Maximum when Corsica and Sardinia were connected forming the largest Mediterranean island. Major palaeogeographic changes occurred before 7 ka BP. Since that period, the significant decrease of the northern ice-sheet melting triggered a significant sea-level stabilization which induced only minor modifications in the palaeogeography of the strait. In the late Holocene, the isostatic-related subsidence became the dominant factor controlling the sea-level changes which rose with rates ≤0.35 mm a−1 in the last four millennia. Our data have also an important archaeological implication because they indicate that the Bonifacio Strait has not represented a significant geographical barrier along the early Neolithic migration path which connected mainland Italy to northern Corsica and finally to Sardinia. This further confirms the ability of early Neolithic communities to navigate not also across large sea stretches but also maritime areas characterized by extremely complex meteomarine conditions.",00253227,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,,

We then used our models to hindcast historical trends in 3D structural complexity using community composition data collected in Moorea from 2004 to 2017.

The monitoring activity was conducted coupling multiple topo-bathymetric surveys and sediment sampling. The data show that the targeted equilibrium profile was attained less than 2 years after the nourishment, and, since that period, the shoreline has shown minimal mobility. Our results show that the positioning of the nourishment material is as important as the correct choice of grain size to attain rapid and successful nourishment of a beach.

This study systematically explores the extent to which LIG constraints could inform future Antarctic contributions to sea-level rise. We develop a Gaussian process emulator of an ice-sheet model to produce continuous probabilistic projections of Antarctic sea-level contributions over the LIG and a future high-emissions scenario. We use a Bayesian approach conditioning emulator projections on a set of LIG constraints to find associated likelihoods of model parameterizations. LIG estimates inform both the probability of past and future ice-sheet instabilities and projections of future sea-level rise through 2150. Although best-available LIG estimates do not meaningfully constrain Antarctic mass loss projections or physical processes until 2060, they become increasingly informative over the next 130 years. Uncertainties of up to 50 cm remain in future projections even if LIG Antarctic mass loss is precisely known (\${\textbackslash}pm\$5 cm), indicating that there is a limit to how informative the LIG could be for ice-sheet model future projections. The efficacy of LIG constraints on Antarctic mass loss also depends on assumptions about the Greenland ice sheet and LIG sea-level chronology.

As a consequence of intensifying disturbances, coral communities are changing rapidly, potentially reducing community-level CaCO3 production. By combining colony-level physiology and long-term monitoring data, we show that reefs recovering from major disturbances can produce 40\% more CaCO3 than currently estimated due to the disproportionate contribution of juvenile corals. However, the buffering effect of highly productive juvenile corals is compromised by recruitment failures, which have been more frequently observed after large-scale, repeated bleaching events. While the size structure of corals can bolster a critical ecological function on reefs, climate change impacts on recruitment may undermine this buffering effect, thus further compromising the persistence of reefs and their provision of important ecosystem services.",13652486,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,,,33749949,

First, satellite-derived InSAR maps are integrated with Sentinel-1A data in order to reveal the socio-temporal variability of subsidence rates which in turn pose challenges in uniformly applying regulatory action. Second, a multi-sectoral mapping of diverse policies and practices spanning urban water supply, groundwater extraction, land use zoning, building codes, tenurial security, and land reclamation reveal the extent to which the broader coastal governance landscape remains fragmented and incongruous, particularly in arresting a multi-dimensional phenomenon such as subsidence.

We reconstructed RSL rise in the north-eastern Adriatic during the Holocene based on 43 RSL index points and analyzed the evolution of coastal submersions on the Istrian Peninsula for the last 5200 years based on inputs of marine components and increases in supratidal scrubs. We produced pollen-based climate reconstructions to analyze the potential effects of air temperature and precipitation changes on submersions. We investigated the response of precipitation and temperature to mid-late Holocene summer/winter insolation forcing and insolation-induced changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We found that during periods of warmer SST, coastal flooding increased markedly. This process seems to have been initiated by warmer atmospheric temperatures that led to increases in summer evaporation, counterbalancing the effects of heavy precipitation during winter. As a result, freshwater flows into coastal areas were reduced and resulted in recurrent inputs of saltwater inland. Our study suggests that present-day climate drivers (increases in SSTs and air temperatures, and decreases in precipitation) will probably favour frequent coastal flooding, a process that will be amplified by RSL rise.",09218181,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,6=highlight,,,

As a consequence, this area is prone to earthquake-generated tsunamis, which affected the Ionian coast of Sicily in historical times. These tsunamis left geomorphic and sedimentary imprints, such as large boulders or high-energy deposits, along the coasts. One of these was reported by previous works along the coast of Ognina, a small residential area located 20 km south of Siracusa. The deposits fill the back edge of a ria incised into Miocene limestones, are composed of three main stratigraphic units and were attributed to several tsunami and storm events that occurred along the coasts of south-eastern Sicily since the IV century Common Era (CE). Here, we use numerical models to simulate the impact of these extreme marine events, at the time of their occurrence, along the Ognina coastal sector, with the aim to: i) better define the tsunamigenic sources responsible for the events found in the deposits, ii) verify if some units could be related to a storm event, iii) investigate constrains on the paleogeography of the studied area at the time of tsunami and storm occurrence. We reconstructed the morphology of ancient local landscapes using geological and historical information, together with a detailed topographic and geoelectrical survey. We implemented a modelling chain (composed of Delft Dashboard, Delft 3d-FLOW and XBeach) to simulate the tsunami and storm wave propagation upon the ancient landscapes. Our results demonstrate that the use of advanced modeling tools, combined with in situ geological evidence and geophysical survey, has the potential to support the attribution of coastal geomorphic imprints to specific tsunami or storm events, the better definition of the paleo-landscapes, and the identification of the most likely tsunamigenic sources. This last aspect plays a fundamental role in providing more reliable characteristics of the tsunami propagation as well as in the assessing of potential tsunami hazard and related coastal impacts.",1040-6182,,,,,,,,,All rights reserved,5=highlight,,,

Past sea-level estimates require elevation measurements and age determination of marine sediments that formed at or near sea level, and those elevations must be corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). However, this GIA correction is subject to uncertainties in the GIA model inputs, namely, Earth's rheology and past ice history, which reduces precision and accuracy in estimates of past GMSL. To better constrain the GIA process, we compare our data and existing LIG sea-level data across the Bahamian archipelago with a suite of 576 GIA model predictions. We calculated weights for each GIA model based on how well the model fits spatial trends in the regional sea-level data and then used the weighted GIA corrections to revise estimates of GMSL during the LIG. During the LIG, we find a 95\% probability that global sea level peaked at least 1.2 m higher than today, and it is very unlikely (5\% probability) to have exceeded 5.3 m. Estimates increase by up to 30\% (decrease by up to 20\%) for portions of melt that originate from the Greenland ice sheet (West Antarctic ice sheet).

Understanding sea level during the peak of the Last Interglacial (125,000 yrs ago) is important for assessing future ice-sheet dynamics in response to climate change. The coasts and continental shelves of northeastern Australia (Queensland) preserve an extensive Last Interglacial record in the facies of coastal strandplains onland and fossil reefs offshore. However, there is a discrepancy, amounting to tens of meters, in the elevation of sea-level indicators between offshore and onshore sites. Here, we assess the influence of geophysical processes that may have changed the elevation of these sea-level indicators. We modeled sea-level change due to dynamic topography, glacial isostatic adjustment, and isostatic adjustment due to coral reef loading. We find that these processes caused relative sea-level changes on the order of, respectively, 10 m, 5 m, and 0.3 m. Of these geophysical processes, the dynamic topography predictions most closely match the tilting observed between onshore and offshore sea-level markers.",2662-4435,2024-02-17,September,en,,,,,,,,,,

Human infrastructures, such as dams, seawalls, and ports, can affect both the sedimentary budget and nearshore hydrodynamics, enhancing and accelerating the loss or gain of coastal sediments. Understanding the processes and factors controlling beach morphodynamics is essential for implementing adequate adaptation strategies in coastal areas, particularly in those regions where coastal protection measures are scarce. This study analyzes shoreline changes in the Keta Municipal District, located in southeastern Ghana (West Africa). This area is characterized by the sedimentary input of the Volta River, forming a river delta situated to the west, i.e., updrift, of our study site. Following the construction of two dams (Akosombo and Kpong) on the Volta River in 1965 and 1982, groins and revetments have been built along the coast between 2005 and 2015 to reduce the high rates of coastal erosion in this area. Here, we explore the influence of these dams and the hard protection constructions on beach morphodynamics using historical maps and satellite images complemented by a shoreline survey undertaken with a differential GNSS in 2015. The multi-decadal evolution between 1913 and 2015 reconstructed for 90 km of shoreline suggests that local erosion rates in the region predate the construction of the two dams on the Volta River, indicating that these structures might not be the primary driver of coastal erosion in this area, as previously suggested. We emphasize that delta dynamics under conditions of high-energy longshore drift, modified by anthropogenic drivers such as sand mining, play a key role in the long-term evolution of this coast. Our results also show that the infrastructures built to halt coastal erosion result in localized erosion and accretion down-current along the coastline towards the border with Togo, highlighting the need for a transnational perspective in addressing the problems caused by coastal erosion.","0276-0460, 1432-1157",2024-02-17,December,en,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last decades, technical advancements in both survey and geochronology have allowed improving our knowledge of past sea-level highstands. This is of prime importance to refine our understanding of processes contributing to sea-level changes, and ultimately to improve both local and global sea-level projections. Last Interglacial sea-level proxies in the Western Indian Ocean (and more specifically the island nation of Madagascar), have been less investigated than in other intertropical oceans over the last decades. As a result, paleo sea-level data in this region are less abundant and less precise than elsewhere. Here, we report the results of two field campaigns aimed at studying the site of Lembetabe, southwest Madagascar, where a fossil reef was first described by the researcher Ren{\'e} Battistini more than 50 years ago. We estimate paleo relative sea level history in space and time from 15 new U-series ages from a fossil reef platform mapped with differential GNSS and drone photogrammetry. Our data suggest that, between 129 ka and 115 ka, paleo relative sea level at this location was about 3.4 $\pm$ 1.4 m above modern. Once corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment, we find that paleo global mean sea level did not exceed 3 m above modern. Only slight crustal subsidence would reconcile the peak Last Interglacial sea level measured at Lembetabe with the 5--10 m range reported in the literature.",0277-3791,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The early Pliocene Epoch is an important target for sea-level reconstructions as it contains information about the stability of ice sheets during a climate warmer than today. Along the southeastern passive margin of Argentina, three paleoshorelines date to early Pliocene times (4.8--5.5 Ma), and their variable present-day elevations (36--180 m) reflect a unique topographic deformation signature. We use a mantle convection model to back-advect present-day buoyancy variations, including those that correspond to the Patagonian slab window. Varying the viscosity and initial tomography-derived mantle buoyancy structures allows us to compute a suite of predictions of DT change that, when compared to GIA-corrected shoreline elevations, makes it possible to identify both the most likely convection parameters and the most likely DT change. Our simulations illuminate an interplay of upwelling asthenosphere through the Patagonian slab window and coincident downwelling of the subducted Nazca slab in the mantle transition zone. This flow leads to differential upwarping of the southern Patagonian foreland since early Pliocene times, in line with the observations. Using our most likely DT change leads to an estimate of global mean sea level of 17.5 $\pm$ 6.4 m (1σ) in the early Pliocene Epoch. This confirms that sea level was significantly higher than present and can be used to calibrate ice sheet models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this chapter, we outline the main processes acting on coastal areas, and link them to distinct types of sea-level indicators, defining general elevation/depth formation ranges for each, which are essential to calculate the paleo relative sea-level position starting from the measured elevation or depth of the landform.",,,,,Reference Module in Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences,,,,,,,,,

Traditional SLIP-based sea-level reconstructions face challenges in capturing continuous sea-level variability and dating erosional SLIPs, such as tidal notches. Here, we propose a novel approach to such challenges. We use a numerical model of cliff erosion embedded within a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the most likely sea-level scenarios responsible for shaping one of the best-preserved tidal notches of Last Interglacial age in Sardinia, Italy. Results align with Glacial Isostatic Adjustment model predictions, indicating that synchronized or out-of-sync ice-volume shifts in Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets can reproduce the notch morphology, with sea level confidently peaking at 6 m and only under a higher than present erosion regime. This new approach yields insight into sea-level trends during the Last Interglacial.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
